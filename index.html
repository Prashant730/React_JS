<!-- why module is use in script tag
The `type="module"` attribute in the `<script>` tag is used to indicate that the JavaScript file should be treated as a module. This allows you to use features such as `import` and `export` statements, which enable you to organize your code into reusable pieces. Modules help in maintaining a clean code structure, avoiding global namespace pollution, and allowing for better dependency management. When a script is defined as a module, it is executed in strict mode by default, which helps catch common coding errors. -->
